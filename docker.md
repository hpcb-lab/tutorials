## Background
Docker is a containerization platform that's grown to become
one of the easiest ways to package environments for running code.
Before Docker, you often had to install all the programs you wanted
to run by hand to try them out. Docker enables you to package all
the programs you might want to run in an "image" that you can share
with others. You can also use images shared on central repositories.

What exactly is a container? A container is a software environment,
just like the operating system and all the programs on your computer.
An "image" is a snapshot of a container in time. For example, imagine
you backed up your computer yesterday, installed a new program this morning,
and backed it up again this afternoon. You now have two "images" (your backups)
of the same "container" (your computer and its programming environment).

Docker enables us to do things like run Linux on our Mac, or install custom code
in a container and run it on the cloud. This second point has been transformative
across tech in the last few years, and today we're going to examine both of these
use cases.

In this tutorial, we're going 

## Step 1: Installing Docker

## Step 2: Building our first image

## Step 3: Pushing our image to Dockerhub

## Step 4: Running an image locally

## Extra Credit: Running our image on FireCloud
